# Polytech-open-exercise

This GitHub repository is meant to be used by students in 6th year in middle school wanting to attempt at polytechnic 
UCL/ULB exam.

When you installed the repository, go to `dist`, then open `main` folder and execute `main.exe` file. 

You'll be able to search for the exercises you want : you can write the whole name of your subject or only the beginning
of the word. (example : instead of *Limites* -> input *lim*)

It will open every exercise you're searching for, listed at : 
https://studentacademy.be/examen-entree/polytech/anciens-examens#/ex-menu/EXALG/mainmenuULB (ULB/UCL algebra, analysis 
and trigonometry)

(PS : `main.py` is not necessary to execute `main.exe`, this file is shared with people who want to see how the program 
works and change it if they need it.)

Good work ! ðŸ—¿
